# ⚡Excel BootCamp - Power Query

## 🏆 Overview
Power Query is a powerful data transformation tool in Excel that allows users to import, clean, and manipulate data efficiently. It helps automate data preparation tasks, making it easier to work with large datasets and ensuring data consistency across reports.

## ❓ What is Power Query?
Power Query is an Excel feature that enables users to extract data from various sources, transform it as needed, and load it into Excel for analysis. It simplifies tasks like merging tables, cleaning messy data, and automating repetitive processes, reducing the need for manual data handling.

## 🔍 Why Use Power Query?
- **Automate Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates, filter data, and transform it efficiently without manual effort.
- **Combine Multiple Data Sources**: Merge and append data from different files, databases, and online sources.
- **Save Time & Improve Accuracy**: Reduce manual data entry errors and automate repetitive tasks.
- **Handle Large Datasets Efficiently**: Work with big data without slowing down Excel’s performance.
- **Create Repeatable Processes**: Once a query is created, it can be refreshed anytime with updated data without redoing steps manually.

## 📅 When to Use Power Query?
- When working with **raw, unstructured, or messy data** that needs formatting and structuring.
- When **importing and merging** data from multiple external sources like databases, web pages, and Excel files.
- When automating **repetitive data transformation tasks** to save time and improve workflow efficiency.
- When dealing with **large datasets** that require optimized processing for analysis and reporting.
