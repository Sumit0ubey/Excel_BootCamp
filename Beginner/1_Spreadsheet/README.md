- **⬆️ Columns**: Run vertically and are labeled alphabetically (A, B, C, ...).

### 🔗 Cell References
Cell references help identify specific cells in a worksheet. They can be:
- **🔄 Relative References** (e.g., A1): Change when copied to another location.
- **📌 Absolute References** (e.g., $A$1): Stay fixed when copied.
- **🔀 Mixed References** (e.g., A$1 or $A1): Partially fixed.

### 🧮 Formulas and Functions
Excel allows users to perform calculations using **formulas** and **functions**:
- **➕ Formula**: A user-defined equation (e.g., `=A1+B1`).
- **🔢 Function**: A pre-built operation (e.g., `=SUM(A1:A10)`).

### 🎨 Formatting Data
Excel provides various formatting options to improve data readability, such as:
- **🖍️ Bold, Italic, and Underline**
