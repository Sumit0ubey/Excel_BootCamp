## 1️⃣ 📋 Tables in Excel
### ✅ What are Excel Tables?
Excel Tables are structured ranges of data that come with built-in functionality like sorting, filtering, and structured references. They help organize and analyze data effectively.

### 🔍 Creating a Table
1. Select the data range (including headers).
2. Go to **Insert** > **Table** or press `Ctrl + T`.
3. Ensure the "My table has headers" box is checked and click **OK**.

### 🛠️ Table Features & Uses
- **Automatic Formatting** 📑 – Applies alternate row shading.
- **Sorting & Filtering** 🔍 – Enables dropdown filters.
- **Dynamic Data Range** 📈 – Automatically expands when adding new data.
- **Structured References** 🔗 – Uses column names instead of cell references.

### 🔄 Sorting & Filtering Data
- Click on the **filter icon** in the header row.
- Choose **Sort A-Z** / **Sort Z-A** or apply custom filters.

### 🏷️ Structured References
Unlike standard cell references (`A1, B2`), structured references use column names:
```excel
=SUM(Table1[Sales])
```
This makes formulas easier to read and maintain.

## 2️⃣ 🎨 Formatting in Excel
### ✅ Basic Formatting
Basic formatting includes adjusting fonts, colors, and alignments to make data more readable.

- **Bold (`Ctrl + B`)**
- **Italics (`Ctrl + I`)**
- **Underline (`Ctrl + U`)**
- **Font & Fill Colors** 🎨
- **Cell Borders** 📏

### 🎯 Conditional Formatting
Conditional Formatting highlights cells based on criteria:
1. Select the range.
2. Go to **Home** > **Conditional Formatting**.
3. Choose rules like **Greater Than, Duplicate Values, Data Bars, Color Scales, or Icon Sets**.

Example: Highlight all sales greater than $10,000.
```excel
= A1 > 10000
```

### ✨ Custom Formatting
Custom formatting changes how data appears without altering its value.

Example: Display numbers as currency:
```excel
$#,##0.00
```

### 🎭 Cell Styles & Themes
- **Predefined Styles** 📜 (e.g., Heading, Title, Good/Bad/Neutral indicators)
- **Custom Styles** 🎨 – Create and save styles for consistency.
- **Themes** 🎭 – Adjust fonts and colors across the workbook.

### 🔎 Data Validation
Restricts input to maintain data integrity.

1. Select a cell/range.
2. Go to **Data** > **Data Validation**.
3. Choose a rule (e.g., allow only numbers between 1-100).

Example: Restrict entry to whole numbers between 1-50.
```excel
Whole Number → Between → 1 and 50
```

## 🎯 Conclusion
Mastering tables and formatting in Excel enhances readability, ensures consistency, and improves data management.🚀
